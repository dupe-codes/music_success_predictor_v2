Tweaking evaluation metric:
    - Originally basing accuracy on raw value closeness within some threshold
    - After analyzing data, thought better to do percentage closeness
    - Tweaked thresholds of allowed percentage difference
        - thought process: How accurate do we gotta be to say we've reasonably predicted popularity?

- Our data is missing a key feature.. lol duh
